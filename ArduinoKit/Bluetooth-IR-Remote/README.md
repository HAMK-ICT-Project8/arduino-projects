# Connect Arduino to Unreal via Bluetooth and handle IR signals

In this project it is demonstrated how to connnect the arduino to the unreal engine via the bluetooth-port and handle IR Signals on the arduino board.


Requirements:
- Arduino UNO
- Sparksfun Bluetooth-Shield
- IR Receiver and IR Remote
- Connection Cables and Breadboard
- Unreal Engine (v 4.25)
- Arduino Kit Plugin (https://github.com/HAMK-ICT-Project8/ArduinoKit)

Tested on:
 - Mac OS âœ…

## Setup

### Arduino

#### Hardware

1. Download the IR Library from https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/archive/master.zip and add it to your Arduino Library folder.
2. Setup the IR Receiver module on the arduino according to this image: https://image.dfrobot.com/image//Blog/Arduino%2014/Fig.%2014-1%20IR%20Receiver%20Diagram.png (in depth guide you can find here: https://www.dfrobot.com/blog-648.html)
3. Setup the bluetooth module according to this image: https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/0/c/d/3/a/521bceb9757b7f63278b4567.png (in depth guide you can find here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-bluesmirf?_ga=2.13681651.518416888.1604914763-1339665885.1604914763)
4. Download the code from this repository and flash it on the arduino
5. Try to connect to it via your devices bluetooth menu.
6. Once connected, you need to find the port-name assigned to it and remember it / write it down / copy it.

#### Find bluetooth portname on Mac OS
Open up a terminal an type in `cd /dev` and then run `ls` and in this list you should find something starting with `tty.` and then something relatable to bluetooth/arduino.

7. There should now be a consistent yellow led on the bluetooth module.

### Unreal Engine
1. Download the ArduinoKit plugin from here: https://github.com/HAMK-ICT-Project8/ArduinoKit and follow its instructions.
2. Open the blueprint edit menu and set it up as shown in the screenshot.
3. Run it
4. You should then be able to turn the light on and off with the IR-Remote.

### Caveat
Be aware that the IR-Remote might send multiple signals if you press the buttons too long and it will toggle the light twice.
Also sometimes the IR-Signal is misinterpreted by the IR-Receiver which leads to unrecognized codes not doing anything.
